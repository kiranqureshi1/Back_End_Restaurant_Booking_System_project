Restaurant Booking System:

Suggested user: Restaurant manager

You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

MVP:

Your system must be able to:

Allow the manager to book a table at the restaurant for a particular customer at a particular time and date
Update a booking, for example if the customer wants to change a booking time
Display a list of bookings for a given date
Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visits


Project Extensions:

Don't allow double bookings
Add a customer's receipt to a booking so you can view their previous orders and how much they spent
Calculate how much a customer has spent over a given period of time
Give discounts to frequent customers
Whatever features you think would be beneficial to a restaurant
